  1)     no of parameter in paper implementation:
                        Total params: 28,919,626
			Trainable params: 28,919,626
			Non-trainable params: 0      

         
         no of parameter in modified model-c:
                        Total params: 578,378
			Trainable params: 577,098
			Non-trainable params: 1,280


2)    we can not directly use cifer-10 becuase:
               
         Their architecture said that their input size =224*224*3 and 1000 label/class which is mismatch with cifer-10


3)  modified model strcuture:

               Conv
               Conv
               pool

               conv
               conv
               pool

               conv
               conv
               pool
              
               FC
               softmax

 all other requirement like pooling,stride and padding and kernel size is same as mentioned in paper.

   i got 96% accuracy using data augmentation.
